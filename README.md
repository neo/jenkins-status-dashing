# NeoDash

## Setup

```ruby
bundle install
dashing start
```

visit http://localhost:3030/ci to view your pretty dashbord.

## Widgets

- Jenkins build status
- Word clock

To configure any of the widgets, edit `config/config.json` and restart the server.

## Notes
Instead of the [original shopyfy dashing](http://shopify.github.io/dashing/), this project uses [a custom Dashing version by @tomazy](https://github.com/tomazy/dashing/tree/dashboard-from-config) (see Gemfile)
